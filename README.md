## Overview

`LoRaNativeApp` is a **React Native (Expo)** mobile application prototype designed for **emergency communication** by leveraging **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**. It facilitates connection to a nearby LoRa antenna/device, enabling peer-to-peer messaging and a dedicated SOS function within an area lacking conventional network coverage.

The core logic handles Bluetooth scanning, connection, service discovery, and message transmission/reception using the `react-native-ble-plx` library, including proper handling of BLE permissions, connection status, and message encoding/decoding.

---

## Features

* **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Scanning:** Discover nearby LoRa antenna devices.
* **Secure Connection Handling:** Manages connection, disconnection, and monitors characteristic notifications (`NOTIFY_CHAR_UUID`).
* **Bi-directional Chat:** Send messages to the connected LoRa device via a designated write characteristic (`WRITE_CHAR_UUID`).
* **Automatic Echo Filtering:** Implements logic to prevent displaying self-sent messages as incoming 'other' messages due to Bluetooth echo.
* **Emergency SOS Button:** A dedicated button to send a priority "Emergencia! SOS! Emergencia!" message.
* **Android & iOS BLE Permissions:** Includes logic for requesting necessary location and Bluetooth permissions on both Android and iOS.
* **Intuitive UI:** Simple three-screen flow: Landing, Scanning, and Chat.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started with LoRaNativeApp, ensure your runtime environment meets the following requirements:

  - **Programming Language:** JavaScript/JSX
  - **Package Manager:** Npm (or Yarn)
  - **Runtime Environment:** Node.js (recommended version matching Expo SDK)
  - **Mobile Environment:** Expo CLI installed globally, and Expo Go app (for quick development) or a native build environment (for full BLE support).

### Installation

Install LoRaNativeApp using one of the following methods:

**Build from source:**

1.  Clone the LoRaNativeApp repository:

<!-- end list -->

```sh
‚ùØ git clone [https://github.com/F3rnandoVil/LoRaNativeApp](https://github.com/F3rnandoVil/LoRaNativeApp)
```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

<!-- end list -->

```sh
‚ùØ cd LoRaNativeApp
```

3.  Install the project dependencies:

**Using `npm`** ¬† ()

```sh
‚ùØ npm install
```

### Usage

Run LoRaNativeApp using the following command:
**Using `npm`** ¬† ()

```sh
‚ùØ npm start
```

This will start the Expo development server. You can then use the **Expo Go** app on your mobile device to scan the QR code and load the app, or run a native build (for full BLE functionality) with `npm run android` or `npm run ios`.

### Testing

This project does not explicitly define a test script in `package.json`. If a testing framework like Jest were to be used, the command would typically be:
**Using `npm`** ¬† ()

```sh
‚ùØ npm test
```

## Project Roadmap

  - [X] **`Task 1`**: <strike>Implement feature one. (BLE scanning and basic UI complete)</strike>
  - [ ] **`Task 2`**: Implement persistent message storage (e.g., using AsyncStorage).
  - [ ] **`Task 3`**: Implement a more robust mechanism for handling multiple LoRa nodes/routing, beyond a single connection.
